## 1. Introduction

The general introduction of estimand framework includes four parts:

-   Trial Objective
An **estimand** is a precise description of the treatment effect reflecting the clinical question posed by a given clinical trial objective, via specifying five attributes: Population, Treatment, Endpoint, Population-level Summary, Intercurrent Events.


## 2. Causal Parameter and Identifiability

### 2.1 Treatment Policy

The treatment policy strategy includes all post-randomization data, regardless of the intercurrent events. In this approach, the primary analysis treats the occurrence of intercurrent events as part of the real-world scenario. Thus, data is collected and analyzed as if all patients followed the initial treatment assignment, irrespective of deviations. (Intention to treat - ITT)

Example: A clinical trial where patients switch to a different medication due to adverse effects, but all data (pre- and post-switch) are included in the primary analysis.

```{r stg1, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE, eval = T, echo = F, include = T, fig.align='center'}
