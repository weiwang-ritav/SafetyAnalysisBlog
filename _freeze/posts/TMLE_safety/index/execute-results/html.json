Introduction\n\nThe general introduction of estimand framework includes four parts:\n\n-   Trial Objective\nAn **estimand** is a precise description of the treatment effect reflecting the clinical question posed by a given clinical trial objective, via specifying five attributes: Population, Treatment, Endpoint, Population-level Summary, Intercurrent Events.\n\n\n## 2. Causal Parameter and Identifiability\n\n### 2.1 Treatment Policy\n\nThe treatment policy strategy includes all post-randomization data, regardless of the intercurrent events. In this approach, the primary analysis treats the occurrence of intercurrent events as part of the real-world scenario. Thus, data is collected and analyzed as if all patients followed the initial treatment assignment, irrespective of deviations. (Intention to treat - ITT)\n\nExample: A clinical trial where patients switch to a different medication due to adverse effects, but all data (pre- and post-switch) are included in the primary analysis.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" paged.print='false'}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## 3.
