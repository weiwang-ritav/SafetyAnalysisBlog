Introduction\n\nAs pointed by this paper, the health intervention a patient receives in observational studies is generally not assigned randomly but is chosen by the patient or physician based on characteristics of the patient. This paper focuses on two important questions:\n\n-   When is it possible to estimate the effect of some health intervention on a safety or an effectiveness outcome without bias?\n\n-   And if it is possible, how can we estimate the effect.\n\nTo address the first question, this paper discusses the potential outcomes framework and use it to formally define a target causal parameter that they wish to estimate and briefly review conditions under which it is possible to estimate the parameter without bias. \n\nTo address the second question, this paper reviews common estimation methods including a method based on the G-computation formula, inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW), and propensity score (PS) matching, and compare them to doubly robust (DR) methods such as augmented IPTW (AIPTW), targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) and collaborative TMLE (CTMLE), an estimator that uses a data-adaptive estimate of the PS in collaboration with the outcome regression. \n\nThen they compare methods in a real data example, a simplified version of a drug safety surveillance study to motivate our question of interest and demonstrate the estimation methods.\nThe data set is a subset of data from Kaiser Permanente Northern California formatted according to the specification of Food and Drug Administrationâ€™s Mini-Sentinel drug safety surveillance program. \n\nThe objective of this paper is to compare the performance of a targeted maximum lilelihood estimator (TMLE) and a collaborative TMLE (CTMLE) to other estimators in a druf safety analysis, including a regression-based estimator, propensity score (PS)- based estimators, and an alternative doubly robust (DR) estimator in a real example and simulations.\n\n## 2. Causal Parameter and Identifiability\n\n### 2.1 Treatment Policy\n\nThe treatment policy strategy includes all post-randomization data, regardless of the intercurrent events. In this approach, the primary analysis treats the occurrence of intercurrent events as part of the real-world scenario. Thus, data is collected and analyzed as if all patients followed the initial treatment assignment, irrespective of deviations. (Intention to treat - ITT)\n\nExample: A clinical trial where patients switch to a different medication due to adverse effects, but all data (pre- and post-switch) are included in the primary analysis.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" paged.print='false'}\n\n:::\n\n\n## 3.
